    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 19, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This policy outlines what data we collect and why, how your data is handled, and your rights regarding your data. 
      We do not sell your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy applies to all products and services provided by 
      <a href="https://youtubetomp4.pro/" target="_blank">Youtubetomp4.pro</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Collect and Why</h2>
    <p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:</p>

    <h3>Identity & Access</h3>
    <p>
      We collect identifying information such as your name, email address, or phone number. 
      This information is necessary to provide essential product functionality and to send you 
      product updates and other important information.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Security and Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      We commit to securing your personal data with SSL encryption and additional safeguards 
      against unauthorized access or alteration. Access is limited to Youtubetomp4.pro employees 
      under strict confidentiality agreements. However, no security system is infallible; we 
      cannot guarantee absolute protection. By using our services, you acknowledge this and 
      agree that Youtubetomp4.pro is not liable for damages resulting from security breaches 
      beyond our control.
    </p>

    <h3>Website Interactions</h3>
    <p>We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes, such as conversion rate testing and product design improvements. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser and operating system versions</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Web pages visited and their loading times</li>
      <li>Referring websites</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Anti-bot Assessments</h3>
    <p>
      We employ third-party CAPTCHA services across our applications to prevent spam and 
      protect against automated attacks.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>We use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store your preferences</li>
      <li>Facilitate easier use of our applications</li>
      <li>Perform A/B testing</li>
      <li>Support analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A cookie is a text file stored by your browser that may help remember login information and site preferences. 
      It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, visited web pages, 
      visit duration, viewed content, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings 
      and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although Youtubetomp4.pro may not 
      function properly if you disable cookies.
    </p>

    <h3>Voluntary Correspondence</h3>
    <p>
      When you contact us with questions or for assistance, we maintain that correspondence, 
      including your email address, to have a history of past communications for future reference.

    <h2>When We Access or Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We access or share your data in these circumstances:</p>
    <ol>

        run our applications and provide the Services to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding abuse. Accessing a customer's account 
        when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We balance protecting 
        both our customers' privacy and the safety of people reporting issues.
      </li>

    <h2>Government Requests for User Data</h2>
    <p>
      Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless compelled by 
      legal process or in limited emergency circumstances. If U.S. law enforcement authorities 
      have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to share data, 
      we must comply. We will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the 
      U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal 
      assistance treaty or agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will notify affected users before sharing data unless legally prohibited from doing 
      so or in emergency cases.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Secure Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted between our servers and your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      When you delete any content, it becomes immediately inaccessible. Accounting for database 
      backups, this content will be completely purged from our systems within 90 days.
    </p>

    <h2>Location of Site and Data</h2>
    <p>
      Youtubetomp4.pro is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European 
      Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information

      website or services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to 
      this transfer.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes & Questions</h2>

      We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any 
      new practices. When we make significant changes to our policies, we will update the date
