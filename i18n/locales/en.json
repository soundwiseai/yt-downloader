  "downloader_faq1Question": "1. Can I download just a specific part of a YouTube video?",
  "downloader_faq1Answer": "While our tool is designed to download the entire video from the URL, this is a common need for editors. The best practice is to use our downloader to quickly save the full, high-quality video file to your device first. Then, you can use any standard video editing software (like CapCut, iMovie, or Adobe Premiere) to easily trim the exact clip you need. This ensures you have the original file for any future use.",
  "downloader_faq2Question": "2. What is the difference between MP4, WEBM, and MP3 formats?",
  "downloader_faq2Answer": "Great question!\n\n<strong>- MP4</strong> is the most universally compatible video format, working on nearly all devices and platforms. It offers a great balance of quality and file size. We recommend this for most users.\n\n<strong>WEBM</strong> is a modern, open-source format developed by Google, often providing smaller file sizes at a similar quality to MP4, but it might not be supported by older devices or some video editors.\n\n<strong>MP3</strong> is an audio-only format. Choose this if you only want to extract the audio from a YouTube URL, like for a podcast, music, or speech",
  "downloader_faq3Question": "3. Is it legal to download videos using a YouTube URL downloader?",
  "downloader_faq3Answer": "The legality depends on the content and how you intend to use it. It is generally legal to download videos that are in the public domain or have a Creative Commons (CC) license. For copyrighted content, downloading a video for your own personal, offline viewing is often considered \"fair use\" in many regions. However, redistributing, remixing, or monetizing copyrighted content without permission from the owner is illegal. We encourage you to respect copyright laws and the terms of service of YouTube.",
  "downloader_faq4Question": "4. I tried to download a private or age-restricted video, and it didn't work. Why?",
  "downloader_faq4Answer": "Our tool respects user privacy and YouTube's platform rules. It functions as a digital \"VCR,\" meaning it can only access and record what is publicly available. If a video is set to \"Private,\" \"Unlisted\" (unless you have the link), or has an age-gate that requires you to be logged in to verify your age, our server cannot access it. We do not bypass any of YouTube's privacy or access controls.",
  "downloader_faq5Question": "5. Are there any limits on how many videos I can download or the length of the videos?",
  "downloader_faq5Answer": "No, there are no limits! Our service is completely free and unlimited. You can download YouTube videos by pasting the URL as many times as you want, regardless of the video's length—from a 10-second Short to a 10-hour documentary.",

    "transcript_faqTitle": "Your In-Depth YouTube Transcript Questions, Answered",
    "transcript_faq1Question": "1. Is this an AI transcription, and how accurate is it?",
    "transcript_faq1Answer": "This is a key question. Our tool is not an AI transcription service. It is a caption extractor. It fetches the official, creator-provided or auto-generated captions directly from YouTube. Therefore, the accuracy of the transcript is identical to the accuracy of the captions you see on the YouTube player itself.",
    "transcript_faq2Question": "2. What happens if the YouTube video doesn't have any captions (CC)?",
    "transcript_faq2Answer": "For our YouTube transcript to work, the video must have a caption track available—you should see the \"CC\" icon on the YouTube player. If a video has no captions enabled, our generator cannot create a transcript because there is no text data to extract.",
    "transcript_faq3Question": "3. What's the difference between YouTube's auto-generated captions and manual ones?",
    "transcript_faq3Answer": "Manually created captions are uploaded by the video's creator and are generally highly accurate in terms of wording, spelling, and punctuation. YouTube's speech-recognition algorithm creates auto-generated captions and may contain errors, especially with proper nouns, complex vocabulary, or unclear audio. Our tool will generate the transcript from whichever version is available for the video.",
    "transcript_faq4Question": "4. Can I get a transcript from a very long video, like a 3-hour webinar?",
    "transcript_faq4Answer": "Yes. As long as the video has a caption track, our tool can generate the full transcript regardless of the video's length. The process remains just as fast, as we are simply fetching existing text data.",
    "transcript_faq5Question": "5. How can I best use the transcript with timestamps?",
    "transcript_faq5Answer": "Transcripts with timestamps are incredibly useful. For video editors, they allow you to quickly find the exact moment a specific word is said. For researchers and students, they are essential for creating accurate citations. You can also use them to create interactive \"clickable\" transcripts where clicking a timestamp navigates a user to that point in the video.",
    "transcript_faq6Question": "6. I see some errors in the generated transcript. Can you fix them?",
    "transcript_faq6Answer": "Since we extract the transcript directly from YouTube's data, any errors in wording or punctuation originate from the source captions themselves. We cannot correct them automatically. However, we provide the text in an easy-to-edit format (copy-paste or a .txt file) so you can quickly make any corrections or formatting changes yourself."
