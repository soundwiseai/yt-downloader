  "downloader_faq1Question": "1. Can I download just a specific part of a YouTube video?",
  "downloader_faq1Answer": "While our tool is designed to download the entire video from the URL, this is a common need for editors. The best practice is to use our downloader to quickly save the full, high-quality video file to your device first. Then, you can use any standard video editing software (like CapCut, iMovie, or Adobe Premiere) to easily trim the exact clip you need. This ensures you have the original file for any future use.",
  "downloader_faq2Question": "2. What is the difference between MP4, WEBM, and MP3 formats?",
  "downloader_faq2Answer": "Great question!\n\n<strong>- MP4</strong> is the most universally compatible video format, working on nearly all devices and platforms. It offers a great balance of quality and file size. We recommend this for most users.\n\n<strong>WEBM</strong> is a modern, open-source format developed by Google, often providing smaller file sizes at a similar quality to MP4, but it might not be supported by older devices or some video editors.\n\n<strong>MP3</strong> is an audio-only format. Choose this if you only want to extract the audio from a YouTube URL, like for a podcast, music, or speech",
  "downloader_faq3Question": "3. Is it legal to download videos using a YouTube URL downloader?",
  "downloader_faq3Answer": "The legality depends on the content and how you intend to use it. It is generally legal to download videos that are in the public domain or have a Creative Commons (CC) license. For copyrighted content, downloading a video for your own personal, offline viewing is often considered \"fair use\" in many regions. However, redistributing, remixing, or monetizing copyrighted content without permission from the owner is illegal. We encourage you to respect copyright laws and the terms of service of YouTube.",
  "downloader_faq4Question": "4. I tried to download a private or age-restricted video, and it didn't work. Why?",
  "downloader_faq4Answer": "Our tool respects user privacy and YouTube's platform rules. It functions as a digital \"VCR,\" meaning it can only access and record what is publicly available. If a video is set to \"Private,\" \"Unlisted\" (unless you have the link), or has an age-gate that requires you to be logged in to verify your age, our server cannot access it. We do not bypass any of YouTube's privacy or access controls.",
  "downloader_faq5Question": "5. Are there any limits on how many videos I can download or the length of the videos?",
  "downloader_faq5Answer": "No, there are no limits! Our service is completely free and unlimited. You can download YouTube videos by pasting the URL as many times as you want, regardless of the video's length—from a 10-second Short to a 10-hour documentary.",

  "transcript_faqTitle": "Your Questions, Answered",
  "transcript_faq1Question": "1. What if a YouTube video doesn't have subtitles or captions?",
  "transcript_faq1Answer": "Our tool can only extract transcripts from videos that have subtitles or closed captions available. These can be either manually created by the video uploader or automatically generated by YouTube. If a video doesn't have any subtitles available, our tool will notify you. In such cases, you might want to try our YouTube to MP3 converter and use a separate speech-to-text service for transcription.",
  "transcript_faq2Question": "2. What's the difference between TXT, SRT, and VTT transcript formats?",
  "transcript_faq2Answer": "Great question!\n\n<strong>- TXT</strong> is a simple plain text format that contains only the spoken words without any timing information. It's best for when you just need the content for reading or reference.\n\n<strong>- SRT</strong> (SubRip Text) is the most common subtitle format that includes both text and precise timestamps. It's perfect for video editing, creating your own subtitles, or following along with exact timing.\n\n<strong>- VTT</strong> (Web Video Text Tracks) is a modern format designed specifically for web videos. It's similar to SRT but with better support for styling and positioning in web players.",
  "transcript_faq3Question": "3. Is it legal to extract transcripts from YouTube videos?",
  "transcript_faq3Answer": "Generally, extracting transcripts for personal use, research, educational purposes, or accessibility is considered fair use in most regions. However, republishing entire transcripts without permission or proper attribution could potentially infringe on copyright. We recommend using extracted transcripts for personal study, research, or accessibility purposes, and always citing the original source appropriately if you quote from them in your own work.",
  "transcript_faq4Question": "4. I tried to extract a transcript from a private or age-restricted video, and it didn't work. Why?",
  "transcript_faq4Answer": "Our tool respects user privacy and YouTube's platform rules. It can only access and extract transcripts from videos that are publicly available. If a video is set to \"Private,\" \"Unlisted\" (unless you have the link), or has an age-gate that requires you to be logged in to verify your age, our server cannot access its subtitles. We do not bypass any of YouTube's privacy or access controls.",
  "transcript_faq5Question": "5. Are there any limits on how many transcripts I can extract or the length of the videos?",
  "transcript_faq5Answer": "No, there are no limits! Our service is completely free and unlimited. You can extract transcripts by pasting the YouTube URL as many times as you want, regardless of the video's length—from a 30-second clip to a 3-hour lecture. The only limitation is that the video must have subtitles or captions available."
